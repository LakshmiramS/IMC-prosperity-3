# IMC-prosperity-3

[Aditya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-s-159981299/) and I(team Acme corp) participated in prosperity 3 this year. This repo contains our final submissions for the contest.

We ranked 49th in India and 301th globally, totalling 511K seashells.

Almost all of the code here has been from team [Linear Utility](https://github.com/ericcccsliu/imc-prosperity-2)'s code from Prosperity 2 and adapted to the new setttings of Prosperity 3.
